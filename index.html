    <h1>Website Responsive Redesign</h1>
    <div>
        For this project, I chose the rework the website for Sam's Place, a small local restaurant in Blake Lee, Ohio.
        It is a restaurant I have always wanted to try and one of the few authentic cuisines of the midwest.
        I focused during this project on creating a solid plan before redesign through:
        <ol>
            <li>Identifying Usability Problems</li>
            <li>Creating Visual Redesign</li>
            <li>Creating Responsive Redesign</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            <br>
            Website Usability Issues
        </h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The webpage is hard to use. It is mostly an informational website as there is no online ordering system.
                The only interactive feature they have is a way to contact the restaurant and create reservations. As I
                do not have much information on the actual restaurant workings, I will keep the same overall goal of the
                website: to show opening times, location, and allow for contact/reservations.</li>
            <li>In terms of efficiency, once the user knows what is happening, they is no increased efficiency they can
                gain. They still must fill out the form with their name, email, phone number, message and a CAPTCHA
                regardless of how much they frequent this site. The only efficiency they may gain is that knowing the
                form is for reservations, which is not obvious at first glance.
            </li>
            <li>In terms of memorability, if a user comes back to the website after a while, they will most likely
                remember that to create a reservation, they have to use the form.
            </li>
            <li>In terms of errors, with the contact us form, erroring within the form is hard to understand. If you
                input the CAPTCHA wrong or write an invalid email, it simply creates a new CAPTCHA and tells you to fill
                it out or just tells you to input an email. It does not mention that the email is invalid or the CAPTCHA
                was typed incorrectly. Despite having the contact us form on every page of the website, if you switch
                tabs, all progress is lost. The message box can be resized, but there is really no need and it creates
                formatting issues across each page the more it is resized.
            </li>
            <li>In terms of satisfaction, it does not have a pretty color scheme or texture. Additionally, the highly
                constrasting colors makes the text hard to read in dark settings or to those with poor vision.
            </li>
            <li>There is little responsiveness and there is no change in formatting for phones, tablets, or any other
                dimensions.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Website Accessbility Issues</h2>
        <p>
            I used the website wave.webaim.org determine this websites' accessbility. Overall the website found 42
            points of note. Many of the errors are just bad HTML usage, but there are some key points that are noted
            below:
        <ul>
            <li>There are many points where the constrast between the text and background make it hard to read.</li>
            <li>There is little page organization and no headers found, leading to lackluster organization and no
                logical flow between bunches of text.
            </li>
            <li>The photos do not contain captions, which the website deemed as problematic; however, I would argue many
                of the photos do not need captions and have obvious meanings.
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h1> Creating Visual Resdesign</h1>
        <P>
            I created some low fidelity wireframes with annotations for the reasons behind each change for 3 different
            sizes: tablets, phones, laptops.
